haloooo, heres my steps
1. 
began by adding a root element <text> </text>
2.
then i went for the chap titles
find: [IVX]+\. +.+
replace: <chap>\0</chap>
3.
next i went for quotes
find: ".+"
replace: <quote>\0</quote>
4.
fixed line one by removing the <quote>s
5.
then went through and found all <chap>I. " with out regex on and removed all the errors
6.
then i went with blocking paragraphs kinda like in html with <p>
find: \n\n
replace: </p>\0<p>


if u wanna see any of my work its all in my git under 'Regex 2'
