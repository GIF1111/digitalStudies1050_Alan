    <song>   <!--tried to keep it simple so i choose the lyrics to David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust -->
    <verse num="1">Now Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly
    And the Spiders From Mars
    He played it left hand, but made it too far
    Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band</verse>
    
    <verse num="1">Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
    Like some cat from Japan
    He could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave 'em to hang
    He came on so loaded, man, well-hung and snow-white tan</verse>
    
    <chorus num="1">So where were the spiders
    While the fly tried to break our balls?
    Just the beer light to guide us
    So we bitched about his fans
    And should we crush his sweet hands?</chorus>

    <verse num="3">Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
    The kids were just crass, he was the nazz
    With God-given ass, he took it all too far
    But boy, could he play guitar</verse>

    <chorus num="2">Making love with his ego
    Ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
    Like a leper messiah
    When the kids had killed the man
    I had to break up the band</chorus>
    
    <outro>Ziggy played guitar</outro>
